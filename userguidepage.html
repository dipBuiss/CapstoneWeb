<h1 style="font-size:40px;"> Welcome to the User Guide Page </h1>

	<p> In this following table we showcase the user guide information

	
		
 </p>



<ul>
			<li>How to open the application using Xcode</li>
			

			<li>The application is available on an iOS operating system</li>
			

			<li>list of steps for the user to open the application and use the functionalities available the user</li>

<p> The image above shows the main frame or the screen when the application is open for the first time.


<p> If the user click on the 'notify' button at the left top corner then the user will be prompted with the notification asking the user if to 'allow' the notifications being sent to the user's phone or 'not allow' these notification being set. </p>

<br>
<br>

<p> Next image screen showcases a selection of date including the day of the week, the name of the month, the time of the day for a specific reminder. The 'AM' or 'PM' is also provided for the user to select if the Reminder takes place during the day, or during the night. Once the selected date is chosen, the user can then save the Reminder to the list which is in the final screen or frame of this application. </p>

<br>

<p> An example of this step can be seen in the following image: </p>

<br> <br>


<p> Let's not forget that before the new Reminder is saved, the option that is provided for the user is also the descriptive text which allows the user to not only define what type of Reminder that is, but most importantly provide any additional notes and text pertaining to this Reminder </p>

<br>

<p> You can see this option in the example right bellow. </p>

<p> This is what the final screen or frame of the application looks like. It features the full list of all the reminders that were saved previously in the application. Also, with this design, it's easy to navigate and click on any available reminder located under the main label: 'Your Reminders'. </p>
